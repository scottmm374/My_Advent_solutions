 <h2>
  --- Day 3: Squares With Three Sides ---
 </h2>
 <p>
  Now that you can think clearly, you move deeper into the labyrinth of hallways and office furniture that makes up this part of Easter Bunny HQ. This must be a graphic design department; the walls are covered in specifications for triangles.
 </p>
 <p>
  Or are they?
 </p>
 <p>
  The design document gives the side lengths of each triangle it describes, but...
  <code>
   5 10 25
  </code>
  ?  Some of these aren't triangles. You can't help but mark the impossible ones.
 </p>
 <p>
  In a valid triangle, the sum of any two sides must be larger than the remaining side.  For example, the "triangle" given above is
  <span title="Unless it's on a sphere!">
   impossible
  </span>
  , because
  <code>
   5 + 10
  </code>
  is not larger than
  <code>
   25
  </code>
  .
 </p>
 <p>
  In your puzzle input,
  <em>
   how many
  </em>
  of the listed triangles are
  <em>
   possible
  </em>
  ?
